# minealert-remastered
This is a remake of minecraft server-alerts (look repository) to transfer it from my old account to this new one but with the new version in addition.
To use the project, you can localhost it or import the project by downloading the folder into a new Replit project (replit.com)

Remember to set the right data within the code to allow the bot to send the correct chat message.
During development, I added a dependency in the code to use the API and achieve automation and ease in using the bot. (Warning! You have to create the API yourself! I used Axios).
I have also added the option of being able to choose the language that suits you best, maybe I will develop more languages in the future!
